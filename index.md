## 1. Hero Section

**Title:**

Liminal

**Subtitle:**

A privacy-first browser execution environment with formally enforced safety guarantees.

**Body (2–3 lines max):**

Liminal isolates browsing, transactions, and signing into deterministic, auditable contexts.

Phase 3 is frozen: no transaction submission, no funds movement, no private execution.

---

## 2. What Liminal Is

**Short paragraph:**

Liminal is a browser-based execution environment designed to reduce metadata leakage during web interaction and transaction preparation. It provides scoped signing, read-only blockchain access, and deterministic privacy controls without enabling fund movement.

**Bullet points:**

- Context-isolated execution
- Scoped, auditable signing
- Read-only Solana RPC access
- Deterministic privacy routing
- Formal safety enforcement

---

## 3. What Liminal Is Not

**Bullet list:**

- Not a wallet
- Not a mixer
- Not a relayer
- Not a transaction broadcaster
- Not a custody solution

**Statement:**

Liminal does not submit transactions, move funds, or execute private rails in Phase 3.

## 4. Safety Guarantees (Phase 3)

**Short paragraph:**

Phase 3 is formally frozen and enforced by multiple independent safety layers.

**Table or bullets:**

- Transaction submission: Disabled
- Funds movement: Disabled
- Private rail execution: Disabled
- Relayers: Disabled
- Signing: Enabled (scoped, auditable)
- RPC access: Read-only only

---

## 5. How Safety Is Enforced

**Short paragraph:**

Safety is enforced through defense-in-depth mechanisms that fail fast on violation.

**Bullet list:**

- Hard-coded submission gate
- Locked execution policy
- Runtime invariants
- Global kill-switch
- Phase freeze with audit trail

---

## 6. Audits & Verification

**Paragraph:**

All guarantees are backed by machine-checkable invariants, internal security reviews, and immutable receipts.

- Security Review (Option B)
- Safety Attestation
