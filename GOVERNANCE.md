# Governance

**Phase 3.10 - Frozen**

This document describes the governance structure and decision-making process for Liminal.

---

## Decision Structure

Liminal follows a straightforward governance model focused on maintaining the integrity of the frozen Phase 3 state while allowing documentation improvements.

**High-Level Structure:**

- **Phase 3 Code:** Frozen and immutable (no changes accepted)
- **Documentation:** Accepts contributions (fixes, corrections, improvements)
- **Phase Transitions:** Require explicit, documented phase changes
- **Security Reviews:** Required for any phase transition considerations

---

## Phase 3 Status

**Phase 3 is frozen and will not change.**

Phase 3.10 is frozen as read-only. This means:

- Phase 3 code is permanently locked
- No code changes are accepted
- No feature additions are accepted
- No refactors are accepted
- Execution paths cannot be modified
- Safety guarantees are immutable

**The frozen status of Phase 3 is non-negotiable and permanent.**

---

## Changes and Phase Transitions

**Any changes to execution code require an explicit phase transition.**

Phase transitions are not automatic and are not guaranteed. A phase transition would require:

1. **Explicit Documentation:** A documented phase transition proposal
2. **Security Review:** Comprehensive security reviews for the new phase
3. **Safety Attestation:** Updated safety attestations and guarantees
4. **Policy Updates:** Explicit policy unlocks and updates
5. **Threat Model Updates:** Updated threat model documentation
6. **Formal Approval:** Formal approval process (not defined in Phase 3)

**Phase transitions are not promised, not guaranteed, and not under active consideration.**

---

## Documentation Contributions

**Documentation contributions are accepted within strict limits.**

Documentation contributions are governed by `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

- Documentation fixes (corrections, clarifications)
- Typo corrections (spelling, grammar, formatting)
- Documentation improvements (clarity, structure, diagrams)

**Documentation contributions must not modify Phase 3 code or execution paths.**

---

## Security and Safety

**Security and safety guarantees are maintained through formal processes.**

Security is enforced through:

- **Multiple Protection Layers:** Hard-coded gates, locked policies, invariants, kill-switch
- **Security Reviews:** Comprehensive security audits (Option B completed)
- **Safety Attestations:** Formal safety attestations (Phase 3.10)
- **Threat Models:** Documented threat models and mitigations

**Security reviews and safety attestations are required for any phase transition.**

---

## Decision Authority

**Phase 3 code changes require explicit authority not defined in Phase 3.**

The authority structure for phase transitions and code changes is not defined within Phase 3. Phase 3 exists as a frozen state with no mechanism for self-modification.

**For documentation contributions, see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the review process.**

---

## Documentation Governance

**Documentation changes follow the contribution process.**

Documentation contributions are reviewed to ensure:

- No Phase 3 code changes are included
- Changes align with the frozen Phase 3 state
- Changes improve clarity or accuracy
- Changes respect the immutable nature of Phase 3

**All documentation contributions must be documentation-only.**

---

## Scope and Limitations

**This governance document applies only to Phase 3 (frozen state).**

This document describes governance for:

- Phase 3 (current, frozen state)
- Documentation contributions
- Phase transition requirements (conceptual only)

This document does not describe:

- Future phase governance (not defined)
- Phase 4 governance (not applicable)
- Active development governance (not applicable to Phase 3)

**Governance for future phases would require separate documentation if such phases were to exist.**

---

## Principles

**Core principles that guide governance decisions:**

1. **Phase 3 Immutability:** Phase 3 code is frozen and will not change
2. **Documentation Quality:** Documentation should be accurate, clear, and helpful
3. **Safety First:** Security and safety guarantees are non-negotiable
4. **Transparency:** Decisions and changes are documented and transparent
5. **No Promises:** No promises are made about future phases or capabilities

**These principles apply to all governance decisions and contributions.**

---

## Questions and Clarifications

**Questions about governance should be directed to the documentation.**

For questions about:
- **Contributions:** See `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Current Status:** See `README.md`
- **Future Directions:** See `ROADMAP.md`
- **Security:** See `SECURITY.md`
- **Frequently Asked Questions:** See `FAQ.md`

**Governance questions about Phase 3 are answered by the frozen status: Phase 3 is immutable.**

## Notes

- Phase 3 is frozen and will not change
- Documentation contributions are welcome (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Phase transitions require explicit processes (not defined in Phase 3)
- No promises are made about future governance or phase transitions
- This document describes governance for Phase 3 only
